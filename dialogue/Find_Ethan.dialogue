~ Find_Ethan

Ethan: Counselor!!...I can't..I can't swim
Ethan: I was hiding but I can-....
You see his limbs growing weary, he's so little and can barely keep his mouth and nose above the water 
Think! 
If he holds onto the dock posts, the monster will see him. He's a goner
But if you stick around here waiting, you're both dead anyway
Can this night get any worse?
You: Hold on buddy! Let me see what I can do
