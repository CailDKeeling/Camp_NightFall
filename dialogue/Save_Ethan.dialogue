~ Save_Ethan

You: Okay, buddy. Don't worry. You're getting out of there. Just trust me
Ethan: *actively freaking out in a body of water*
You pray that he understood you
You tie the rope to one of the dock posts above and throw the other end down to Ethan
You: Come on little guy, grab the rope and I'll pull you up
Ethan manages to calm down just enough to hold tight onto the rope
Ethan: Thank you Counselor!
You smile at him and flick his propeller hat
You: You got it little dude
