~ Save_Anna
You notice the bed isn't that thick. There's surely something in your backpack that can cut her out
You: Don't worry honey, I got this.
Anna: Okay *inhales* *exhales*  Okay...
You manage to cut away at the metal casing that confines Anna until she's able to slip out 
Anna: Oh god. Oh God. Thank you!
She rushes to hug you and you hug her back. 
You: Let's go
